# Codeforces Problem Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions to problems from the [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) competitive programming platform! This repository serves as a collection of my solved problems in multiple programming languages: **C++**, **C#**, and **Java**.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each programming language, with subfolders named after the problem IDs. Here's the structure:


Each folder contains the solution to the corresponding problem, named after its problem ID for easy identification.

## ðŸ›  Languages and Tools

- **C++**: Used for performance-critical solutions and STL features.
- **C#**: Preferred for object-oriented solutions and clean code structure.
- **Java**: Leverages robustness and strong library support for problem-solving.
